# startpage-extension
because chrome doesn't like new tabs redirecting to local pages, I made a manifest.json to turn it into an extension stored it in that instead
lightweight and eliminates the need for any new tab redirect extension

focus page is not here thought, gotta figure out how to do that eventually (probably never because im lazy as shit)

thanks to [prettycoffee](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage) for creating the startpage

## preview
this is what my startpage looks like:
![alt text](https://github.com/oaroki-git/startpage-extension/blob/main/startpage.png)

## install
1. clone the repo with git: ```git clone https://github.com/oaroki-git/generic-startpage-local.git```
3. open chrome://extensions (in a chromium browser ofc)
4. enable developer mode
5. click "load unpacked" and choose the startpage-extension-unpacked folder or drag and drop it in

## for other startpages
the most important part of this is just the manifest.json.

replacing the startpage folder with anything works, whether it be your own yet-another-generic-startpage configuration ([tutorial in their repo](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage)) or literally any other cool startpage project from github or yourself!
