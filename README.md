# startpage-extension
because chrome doesn't like new tabs redirecting to local pages, i just made my own and stored it in that instead

thanks to [prettycoffee](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage) for creating the startpage

## preview
this is what my startpage looks like:
![alt text](https://github.com/oaroki-git/startpage-extension/blob/main/startpage.png)

## install
1. clone the repo
2. open chrome://extensions
3. enable developer mode
4. click "load unpacked"
5. choose the startpage-extension-unpacked folder

## for other startpages
the most important part of this is just the manifest.json.

replacing the startpage folder with anything works, whether it be your own yet-another-generic-startpage configuration ([tutorial in their repo](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage)) or literally any other cool startpage project from github or yourself!
