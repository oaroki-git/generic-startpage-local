# startpage-extension
because chrome doesn't like new tabs redirecting to local pages, i just made my own and stored it in that instead

thanks to [prettycoffee](https://github.com/PrettyCoffee/yet-another-generic-startpage) for creating the startpage

y'all can make your own on their repo, download the mini-yags (instructions are on their repo linked above) and replace the startpage folder easy

## preview
this is what my startpage looks like:

## install
1. clone the repo
2. open chrome://extensions
3. enable developer mode
4. click "load unpacked"
5. choose the startpage-extension-unpacked folder
